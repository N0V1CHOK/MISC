# chatgpt was heavily involved in the making if this
this is a simple extrention for firefox that unloads everything except the 3 latest tabs used
to use it you can go to `about:debugging` click on 'This Firefox' and then click on 'Load teporary Add-on'
this method will load the extension but it will disapear after restarting firefox
to have it permanently one must get their extension signed by firefox 
i did get a signed version but i didn't mark it as public to be placed on the mozilla add-on store
in order to get the a signed version one must visit the mozilla developer hub submit the .xpi file and after a moment you'll be able to sownload the signed version and use it
